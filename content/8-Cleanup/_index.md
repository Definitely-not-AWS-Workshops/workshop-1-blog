Congratulations! What a lengthy workshop! Finally, you provided the AnimeHub team with the fundamental steps for building Terraform modules to provision your recommended AWS infrastructure that suits their needs. Additionally, you assisted them in becoming familiar with Terraform Cloud, which could enhance collaborative Terraform within the team.

You now clean up the Terraform-provisioned AWS resources. Cleaning up resources with Terraform may be faster and less error-prone than manually deleting.

Please destroy the resources in the following order: web, app, routing, security, database, image repository, and network workspace.

**6.** Optionally, add a comment `Look good to me!`. Click **Confirm plan**, Terraform will destroy AWS resources for you. After TerraformÂ has done the destroying process, you may access your AWS account to view the Terraform-provided AWS resources destroyed.
