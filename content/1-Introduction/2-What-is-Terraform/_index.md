[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an IaC tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud.

With Terraform for AWS cloud provider, you can quickly and securely provide AWS resources. You can share, reuse, and version these configuration files since they are written in a human-readable manner. Using the application programming interfaces (APIs) of AWS cloud platform and other services, it generates and administers resources with ease. Terraform gives developers the power to design and implement a reproducible, reliable infrastructure, reducing the risk of human error through manual operations.
